Some notes:

every table will likely have additonal columns for version history
(for example:)
    -> version
    -> createTime
    -> active

there will likely be a need for other columns to handle:
    - account authentication
    - Google Cloud Gateway API tokens
    - Firebase tokens for data pushing
    - i'm sure there are more

====================
// singular remote firebase db
REMOTE_ACCOUNT

//maps email -> (accountId, password)
tbl_accounts
    -> email/username       (primary key)
    -> accountId			(foreign key)   //ties all a users devices eachother on a pm account

    //maps accountId -> deviceId
    tbl_devices
        -> deviceId         (primary key)
        -> accountId        (foreign key)
        -> token                            //grants a device access to REMOTE_ACCOUNT

    //maps accountId -> sync
    tbl_sync
        -> accountId		(primary key)
        -> modifiedTime                     //datetime some device made some modification to localDB (account settings or username/password change/add/etc)
        -> syncFlag                         //means some other device was able to sync the modification, i.e. 2 devices have the modification (redundancy)

// singleton LOCAL_MAIN
// allows multiple accounts on same device
// only 1 logged in at a time
LOCAL_MAIN:

tbl_accounts
    -> deviceId 		(primary key) 	//unique to pm_account and device
    -> accountId 		(foreign key) 	//unique to pm_account, shared across devices 
    -> remoteToken                      //grants access to REMOTE_ACCOUNT
    -> localToken                       //grants access to LOCAL_ACCOUNT instance (could this just be an decryption key to LOCAL_ACCOUNT db instance? perhaps AES)
    -> LOCAL_ACCOUNT                    //mapping to LOCAL_ACCOUNT instance

-------------------------------

// instance of a LOCAL_ACCOUNT
LOCAL_ACCOUNT:

// everything required for client2client syncing
// no key (does it need one?)
tbl_accountSync
    -> remoteModifiedTime
    -> remoteSyncFlag
    -> localModifiedTime

// accounts settings (shared between devices)
tbl_accountSettings
    -> ...

// accounts app settings (specific to device)
tbl_appSettings
    -> ...

// maps domainId  -> userAccountId
tbl_domains
    -> domainId 		    (primary key)
    -> userAccountId	    (foreign key)

    // maps userAccountId -> (domainID, urlId)
    tbl_user_accounts
        -> userAccountId 	(primary key)
        -> domainId 		(foreign key)
        -> urlId		    (foreign key)
