# Tyler:
* what went well?
*  Knowing our core idea, and that it didnt change, even if some of the details or broader areas of that idea changed some
* What didnt go so well?
*  Having to change some or details to the core idea
* What have we learned?
*  Learned a more proper way to setup a project from scratch, especially in a team
* What are still issues/problems/puzzles?
*  Getting the more refined and micromanaged details of the database syncing across devices down
* What recommendations would you make for Senior design 1 for next fall? 
*  Make the next class create a set of deadlines for themselves in the spring
* What went well and worked and should be continued?
*  about every other week get togethers with both the mentor, but also with the class. Some other groups were able to help others with things, or how to avoid some group problems
* What didn't go so well and should be changed?
*  I cant say there is much way to change it, but keep people in groups. Seems like this was something many groups faced
