# Matt:
* what went well?
*  Having a unified direction and previous work done from the start really helped move things forward at every step.
* What didnt go so well?
*  Reducing the scope of the project in order to better enable us to get it done in time was a little rough.
* What have we learned?
*  Revising the original plan is not only okay, but necessary a lot of the time.
* What are still issues/problems/puzzles?
*  Database syncing/management as well as other general security concerns.
* What recommendations would you make for Senior design 1 for next fall? 
*  Even though Senior Design 1 focuses primarily on the planning portion of the project, getting some code written in the early stages can really help show design flaws that may need addressed.
* What went well and worked and should be continued?
*  Regular mentor meetings were very insightful and helped to flesh out parts that we hadn't thought of as a group.
* What didn't go so well and should be changed?
*  Nothing really comes to mind.

# Tyler:
* what went well?
*  Knowing our core idea, and that it didnt change, even if some of the details or broader areas of that idea changed some
* What didnt go so well?
*  Having to change some or details to the core idea
* What have we learned?
*  Learned a more proper way to setup a project from scratch, especially in a team
* What are still issues/problems/puzzles?
*  Getting the more refined and micromanaged details of the database syncing across devices down
* What recommendations would you make for Senior design 1 for next fall? 
*  Make the next class create a set of deadlines for themselves in the spring
* What went well and worked and should be continued?
*  about every other week get togethers with both the mentor, but also with the class. Some other groups were able to help others with things, or how to avoid some group problems
* What didn't go so well and should be changed?
*  I cant say there is much way to change it, but keep people in groups. Seems like this was something many groups faced
