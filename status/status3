Planned:

The primary goal of these three weeks was to recap individual findings post break as well as begin assigned issue tracking and other tasks. 
These tasks were decided upon in group meetings according to individual strengths for the good of the project.

Tasks Completed:

Identified where currently known security flaws were located in code base and created plan to deal with them.
Refining current encryption sceme to bring more in line with industry standards [In Progress]
Began implementation of localized database [In Progress]
Began fleshing out UI/UX features including user accounts and capabilities [In Progress]

Successes:

We were able to solve a few hanging design questions along with beginning the implementation of planned systems.

Challenges:

Google technologies are expensive if we aren't careful about usage, could hamper ability to run tests in future. Current fix is for each developer to utilize their own instances 
to increase total potential usage.

Inter-device syncing still has some design questions that will need answered during development stages.

Changes/Deviations:

N/A

Next 3 week goals:
